# sync-android-p2p
This project implements a http listener on top of sync-android to allow sync-android to become a replication target.

This project is a prototype.  It can perform a basic replication based on the steps below, however, a lot more functionality needs to be implemented to support replication proper.  In theory this code should work on Android, but this has not been tried yet.

Expect lots of bugs, this code needs much more testing.

- check out sync-android
```
git clone https://github.com/cloudant/sync-android
cd sync-android
git checkout 4e1b94c290cb01ca524e562f587017b1ea06e55d
```

- we need the lastest sync-android libraries, so install 0.9.4-SNAPSHOT install ~/.m2 repository
```
gradle install
```

- check out this project
```
git clone https://github.com/snowch/sync-android-p2p
cd sync-android-p2p
```

- create a directory to hold the sqlite datastore
```
mkdir -p /tmp/datastores
```

- execute this project
```
gradle execute -DDB_DIR=/tmp/datastores/
```
Example output: `> Building 75% > :execute`


- in another terminal window start couchDB
```
couchdb
```

- create a database on couchdb
```
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5984/newdb
```

- add a document to couchdb
```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '
{
  "_id": "12345"
}' http://localhost:5984/newdb
```

- start replication on couchdb to sync-android
```
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d '
{
  "source": "http://localhost:5984/newdb",
  "target": "http://localhost:8182/mydb"
}' http://localhost:5984/_replicate
```

- make sure our document 12345 was replicated
```
echo 'select * from docs;' | sqlite3 /tmp/datastores/mydb/db.sync
```
Example output: `1|12334`
